# USER DATA

User accounts can be used to store data privately to that user, in addition to several other common features related to account management. Users are created using the CMUser class.

User account functionality can be broken up into three logical sections.

* Account management, including creation, logging in, and password management.
* Storing private data, including storing objects, and storing files.
* Sharing private data via access lists.
